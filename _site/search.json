    "text": "2. Literature Review\nBefore we begin our literature review, it’s important that we start by loading all the necessary datasets provided in the VAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 2.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Loading all datasets and images\ncc &lt;- read_csv(\"data/cc_data.csv\")                  # Add credit card data\nloyalty &lt;- read_csv(\"data/loyalty_data.csv\")        # Add loyalty data\nmc2 &lt;- raster(\"data/MC2-tourist_modified.tif\")      # Add tif file as a raster layer\ngps &lt;- read_csv(\"data/gps.csv\")                     # Add gps data\ncar &lt;- read_csv(\"data/car-assignments.csv\")         # Add car assignments\nAbila_st &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data\", \n                    layer = \"Abila\")\nKronos_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(st_read(dsn = \"data\", \n                              layer = \"Kronos_Island\"))\n\n\nA cursory look at the dataset reveals the following data types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCredit Card.csv (cc)\nAspatial\nCredit card txns by timestamp, location and amt\n\n\nLoyalty.csv\nAspatial\nLoyalty card txns by date, location and amt\n\n\nCar Assignment.csv (car)\nAspatial\nCar assignment ID with individuals’ name and role\n\n\nMC2.jpg\nAspatial\nAbila’s map in jpeg format\n\n\nMC2.tif\nGeospatial\nAbila’s map in a geotiff format\n\n\nGPS.csv (gps)\nGeospatial\nGPS points (latlong) by car ID and timestamp\n\n\nAbila\nGeospatial\nAbila’s road network\n\n\nKronos Island\nGeospatial\nPolygon showing Kronos Island’s admin boundary\n\n\n\nAn in-depth look at the dataset reveals the following fields:\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Name\ncc\nloyalty\ngps\ncar\nmc2\n\n\n\n\nFile Type\ncsv\ncsv\ncsv\ncsv\npic\n\n\nCount\n1,490\n1,392\n685,169\n44\n-\n\n\nDate Format\nm/d/y\nm/d/y\nm/d/y\n-\n-\n\n\nTime Format\nh:m\n-\nh:m:s\n-\n-\n\n\nLocation\nYes\nYes\n-\n-\nYes\n\n\nPrice\nYes\nYes\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nlast4ccnum\nYes\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nloyaltynum\n-\nYes\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nID\n-\n-\nYes\nYes\n-\n\n\nLatlong\n-\n-\nYes\n-\n-\n\n\nNames\n-\n-\n-\nYes\n-\n\n\nEmployment Details\n-\n-\n-\nYes\n-\n\n\n\nNot all files have the same fields. While it’s easy to merge gps and car data using its unique ID, there are no unique fields tying the cc and loyalty data together. Thus, merging both cc and loyalty data together would require some form of fuzzy joining logic. Separately, to add to the complexity, we would need to identify the various locations within the gps data, using both the cc and mc2 map.\n\nWith these dataset in mind, the following considerations would need to be addressed.\n\n2.1 Fuzzy Matching\nThere are a few ways to employ fuzzy matching in our dataset. One is to use the native adist function within R, but its processing time leaves much to be desired. The other is to use packages specifically designed for fuzzy matching. One such package that is built for speed in matching similar phrases is stringdist. It uses openMP for parallel computing to speed up its matching of unequal content. The only downside (though it’s hardly a downside) is that it requires the columns of comparison to be housed in the same dataframe. Fuzzyjoin, built on top of stringdist, allows comparison of columns housed in different dataset, and its output include a merging of both datasets.\n\nUnfortunately, deciding on the fuzzy logic package is the easy part. The harder part is to decide on the appropriate fuzzy join logic. Here’s a list of distance metrics currently supported by stringdist:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nosa\nOptimal string aligment, (restricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance)\n\n\nlv\nLevenshtein distance (as in R’s native adist).\n\n\ndl\nFull Damerau-Levenshtein distance.\n\n\nhamming\nHamming distance (a and b must have same nr of characters).\n\n\nlcs\nLongest common substring distance\n\n\nqgram\nq-gram distance\n\n\ncosine\ncosine distance between q-gram profiles\n\n\njaccard\nJaccard distance between q-gram profiles\n\n\njw\nJaro, or Jaro-Winkler distance\n\n\n\nOut of the above methods, osa, lv and dl seems most apt, since we’re dealing with phrases of differing lengths and are more concerned with slight edits, realignment, addition and subtraction of letters within these phrases. We’ll rely on the osa method then, since it’s a balance between finding the right edits and speed.\n\n\n2.2 Map Visualisations of GPS Data\nWhile it makes sense to convert our GPS points into spatial lines, using the furnished map pic as a basemap is less than ideal. As shown below, it’s unclear whether the GPS path coincides with the location icons shown on the map. These icons are far too large, and does not reflect whether these GPS points either stopped at or merely drove past these points. At the same time, the GPS path seem to run on a road network, that is not reflected within the furnished map pic.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngps$Timestamp &lt;- date_time_parse(gps$Timestamp,\n                                 zone = \"UTC\",\n                                 format = \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\") # Readjust loyalty timestamp\ngps$day &lt;- as_factor(get_day(gps$Timestamp))                   # Extract day of month and convert to factor data type\ngps$id &lt;- as_factor(gps$id)                                    # Change to factor data type\n\ngps_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(gps, \n                   coords = c(\"long\", \n                              \"lat\"), \n                   crs = 4326)                                 # Changing into a shapefile\n\ngps_path1 &lt;- gps_sf %&gt;% # Grouping gps lines according to id and day of month\n  group_by(id, day) %&gt;%\n  summarize(m = mean(Timestamp),\n            do_union = FALSE,\n            .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  st_cast(\"LINESTRING\") # Change GPS into a line\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\nQ2.2_mc2 &lt;- tm_shape(mc2) +\n              tm_raster(legend.show = FALSE) +\n              # tm_raster(palette = c(\"#979D9D\",\n              #                       # \"#A3A7A7\",\n              #                       # \"#B1B2B2\",\n              #                       # \"#B6B5B3\",\n              #                       # \"#B4AFA9\",\n              #                       \"#B3A9A1\")\n              #        ,alpha = NA\n              #        # ,\n              #        # saturation = 1,\n              #        # interpolate = TRUE,\n              #        # max.value = 255\n              #        ) +\n              # tm_rgb(mc2,                      # tm_rgb used to work in the previous tmap versions, but are now unable to render multiple bands in a single raster layer\n              #        r = 1,\n              #        g = 2,\n              #        b = 3,\n              #        alpha = NA,\n              #        saturation = 1,\n              #        interpolate = TRUE,\n              #        max.value = 255) +\n            tm_shape(gps_path1 %&gt;%\n                     filter(id==1)) +\n              tm_lines()\n\nQ2.2_mc2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, we are provided with the Abila road network. This granular road network is not reflected at all within the map pic. Taking inspiration from City University London’s entry, they made great use of the Abila road network to create their own map (reproduced below). They then coupled this road network with actual location points that they have derived from the data. We will borrow this visualisation format as a basis for our own visualisation. To bring it a step further, we will recreate this map in an interactive fashion in subsequent sections. For now, let’s prepare the necessary data."

Literature Review\nBefore we begin our literature review, it’s important that we start by loading all the necessary datasets provided in the VAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 2.\n\n# Loading all datasets and image\ncc &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/cc_data.csv\") # Add credit card data\nloyalty &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/loyalty_data.csv\") # Add loyalty data\nmc2 &lt;- raster(\"data/MC2-tourist_modified.tif\") # Add tif file as a raster layer\ngps &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/gps.csv\") # Add gps data\ncar &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/car-assignments.csv\") # Add car assignments\nAbila_st &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data\", layer = \"Abila\")\nKronos_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(st_read(dsn = \"data\", layer = \"Kronos_Island\"))\n\nA cursory look at the dataset reveals the following data types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCredit Card.csv (cc)\nAspatial\nCredit card txns by timestamp, location and amt\n\n\nLoyalty.csv\nAspatial\nLoyalty card txns by date, location and amt\n\n\nCar Assignment.csv (car)\nAspatial\nCar assignment ID with individuals’ name and role\n\n\nMC2.jpg\nAspatial\nAbila’s map in jpeg format\n\n\nMC2.tif\nGeospatial\nAbila’s map in a geotiff format\n\n\nGPS.csv (gps)\nGeospatial\nGPS points (latlong) by car ID and timestamp\n\n\nAbila\nGeospatial\nAbila’s road network\n\n\nKronos Island\nGeospatial\nPolygon showing Kronos Island’s admin boundary\n\n\n\nAn in-depth look at the dataset reveals the following fields:\n\n\n\nFile Name\ncc\nloyalty\ngps\ncar\nmc2\n\n\n\n\nFile Type\ncsv\ncsv\ncsv\ncsv\npic\n\n\nCount\n1,490\n1,392\n685,169\n44\n-\n\n\nDate Format\nm/d/y\nm/d/y\nm/d/y\n-\n-\n\n\nTime Format\nh:m\n-\nh:m:s\n-\n-\n\n\nLocation\nYes\nYes\n-\n-\nYes\n\n\nPrice\nYes\nYes\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nlast4ccnum\nYes\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nloyaltynum\n-\nYes\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nID\n-\n-\nYes\nYes\n-\n\n\nLatlong\n-\n-\nYes\n-\n-\n\n\nNames\n-\n-\n-\nYes\n-\n\n\nEmployment Details\n-\n-\n-\nYes\n-\n\n\n\nNot all files have the same fields. While it’s easy to merge gps and car data using its unique ID, there are no unique fields tying the cc and loyalty data together. Thus, merging both cc and loyalty data together would require some form of fuzzy joining logic. Separately, to add to the complexity, we would need to identify the various locations within the gps data, using both the cc and mc2 map.\nWith these dataset in mind, the following considerations would need to be addressed:\n\n2.1 Fuzzy Matching\nThere are a few ways to employ fuzzy matching in our dataset. One is to use the native adist function within R, but its processing time leaves much to be desired. The other is to use packages specifically designed for fuzzy matching. One such package that is built for speed in matching similar phrases is stringdist. It uses openMP for parallel computing to speed up its matching of unequal content. The only downside (though it’s hardly a downside) is that it requires the columns of comparison to be housed in the same dataframe. Fuzzyjoin, built on top of stringdist, allows comparison of columns housed in different dataset, and its output include a merging of both datasets.\nUnfortunately, deciding on the fuzzy logic package is the easy part. The harder part is to decide on the appropriate fuzzy join logic. Here’s a list of distance metrics currently supported by stringdist:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nosa\nOptimal string aligment, (restricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance)\n\n\nlv\nLevenshtein distance (as in R’s native adist).\n\n\ndl\nFull Damerau-Levenshtein distance.\n\n\nhamming\nHamming distance (a and b must have same nr of characters).\n\n\nlcs\nLongest common substring distance\n\n\nqgram\nq-gram distance\n\n\ncosine\ncosine distance between q-gram profiles\n\n\njaccard\nJaccard distance between q-gram profiles\n\n\njw\nJaro, or Jaro-Winkler distance\n\n\n\nOut of the above methods, osa, lv and dl seems most apt, since we’re dealing with phrases with differing lengths and are more concerned with slight edits, realignment, addition and subtraction of letters within these phrases. We’ll rely on the osa method since it’s a balance between finding the right edits and speed.\n\n\n2.2 Map Visualisations of GPS Data\nWhile it makes sense to convert our GPS points into spatial lines, using the furnished map pic as a basemap is less than ideal. As shown below, it’s unclear whether the GPS path coincides with the location icons shown on the map. These icons are far too large, and does not reflect whether these GPS points either stopped at or merely drove past these points. At the same time, the GPS path seem to run on a road network, that is not reflected within the furnished map pic.\n\n# gps$Timestamp &lt;- date_time_parse(gps$Timestamp,\n#                 zone = \"UTC\",\n#                 format = \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\") # Readjust loyalty timestamp\n# gps$day &lt;- as_factor(get_day(gps$Timestamp)) # Extract day of month and convert to factor data type\n# gps$id &lt;- as_factor(gps$id) # Change to factor data type\n# \n# gps_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(gps, coords = c(\"long\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326) # Changing into a shapefile\n# \n# gps_path1 &lt;- gps_sf %&gt;% # Grouping gps lines according to id and day of month\n#   group_by(id, day) %&gt;%\n#   summarize(m = mean(Timestamp),\n#             do_union=FALSE,\n#             .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n#   st_cast(\"LINESTRING\") # Change GPS into a line\n# \n# tmap_mode(\"view\")\n# Q2.2_mc2 &lt;- tm_shape(mc2) +\n#               tm_rgb(mc2, r = 1,g = 2,b = 3,\n#                    alpha = NA,\n#                    saturation = 1,\n#                    interpolate = TRUE,\n#                    max.value = 255) +\n#             tm_shape(gps_path1 %&gt;%\n#                      filter(id==1)) +\n#               tm_lines()\n# \n# Q2.2_mc2\n\nAt the same time, we are provided with the Abila road network. This granular road network is not reflected at all within the map pic. Taking inspiration from City University London’s entry, they made great use of the Abila road network to create their own map (reproduced below). They then coupled this road network with actual location points that they have derived from the data. We will borrow this visualisation format as a basis for our own visualisation. To bring it a step further, we will recreate this map in an interactive fashion in subsequent sections. For now, let’s prepare the necessary data.\n\n\n\nCity University London’s MC2 Sample Map Entry"

    "text": "3. Data Comprehension\nAs always, we review each dataset in greater detail. This is a necessary step in order to accurately prepare the data for subsequent use.\n\nWhile reviewing the four csv data, we immediately noticed a few potential issues:\n1. Date format within the timestamp were in a MM-DD-YYYY H:M format\n2. Katerina’s Cafe contains unique characters, which may cause downstream problems during our analysis\n3. ID and Last4CCNum are treated as regular double numbers, instead of a character type\n4. Names and roles are broken up into multiple columns within the car data\n\nThus, we address these potential issues as well as create and simplify other columns for subsequent ease in analysis.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#--------------- Cleaning CC data ---------------\n\ncc$timestamp &lt;- date_time_parse(cc$timestamp,\n                zone = \"UTC\",\n                format = \"%m/%d/%Y  %H:%M\")              #

Data Exploration Analysis\nHere we will answer the VAST Challenge questions.\n\n5.1 Question 1 And Its Answers\nUsing just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.\n\n5.1.1 Popular Locations Seem To Revolve Ard Food And Beverages\nFood and beverage places, such as Brew’ve Been Served, Guy’s Gyros, Hallowed Grounds etc. seem to be the more popular locations, as highlighted in the dark grey tiles below.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncc_calendar &lt;- cc %&gt;%\n  count(dayofmonth, \n        location)                                           # Group and tally by day of month and location\ncc_calendar$dayofmonth &lt;- as_factor(cc_calendar$dayofmonth) # CHange day of month to factor type\n\n# Create calendar heatmap using ggplot and geom_tile\nQ5.1.1 &lt;- ggplot(complete(cc_calendar, \n                          dayofmonth, \n                          location), \n                 aes(x = dayofmonth, \n                     y = location)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = n), \n            color = \"white\", \n            size = 0.1) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"light grey\", \n                      high = \"black\", \n                      na.value = \"light grey\") +\n  scale_y_discrete(expand = expansion(add = 1.6),\n                   limits = rev) +\n  labs(title = \"Calendar Heatmap of Location Visit Frequency (From CC Data) By Date\",\n       subtitle = \"Food and coffee outlets seem to be the most frequented, based on credit card data\",\n       x = \"Day of Month\",\n       fill = \"Frequency Of Visit\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        panel.border = element_blank(),\n        panel.spacing = unit(0.1, \"cm\"),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        text = element_text(size=7),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -3),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\nQ5.1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Kronos Mart’s Txns Suggest Tampering\nThe txn dates of Kronos Mart differ by exactly one day, comparing either side of the credit card and loyalty data.

Here, using looking at the GPS data, single visits on 9th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th and three visits on 18th suggests that these GPS visits matches more to loyalty data than the credit card data.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create new df of gps data specifically on Kronos Mart's tracking\nQ5.2.1_gps &lt;- tibble(\"dayofmonth\" = c(6:19)) %&gt;%\n                  left_join(spots %&gt;%\n                              group_by(Location, \n                                       dayofmonth) %&gt;%\n                              tally() %&gt;%\n                              filter(Location == \"Kronos Mart\") %&gt;%\n                              ungroup(), \n                            by = \"dayofmonth\") %&gt;%\n                  mutate(n2 = n) %&gt;%\n                  replace_na(list(n = 0))\n\n# Showcase Kronos Mart's GPS activity via a geom-area visualisation\nQ5.2.1 &lt;- ggplot(Q5.2.1_gps,\n                  aes(x = dayofmonth, \n                      y = n)) +\n  geom_area(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n2), \n            na.rm = TRUE,\n            vjust = -1,\n            size = 3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(6,\n                                  19,\n                                  1)) +\n  ylim(0,\n       5) +\n  labs(\"title\" = \"GPS Movements to Kronos Mart Validates Loyalty Data\",\n       \"subtitle\" = \"GPS data seem to validate the loyalty data, more than the credit card data\") +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\nQ5.2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 GPS Validates F&B Outlets From Earlier Credit Card Data; Other Outlets Seem To Have Unmatched Visits\nVisitations to unknown locations such as Hippokampos and Abila Zacharo during noon / lunch time confirms these locations as food outlets. However, visit frequency to other locations seem to differ:\n- Some locations such as Bean There Done That, Brewed Awakenings and Jack’s Magical Beans has high gps visits in the morning, whereas credit card data shows stronger transactions during lunch time\n- Kronos Mart’s GPS data suggests more activity between 12 noon to midnight, but credit card data suggests more activity between midnight and 12 noon\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create ridgeline plot of GPS locations by hours of day, and excluding Home, Anonymous locations and Gastech.\nQ5.2.2 &lt;- ggplot(spots %&gt;%\n                   filter(!grepl(\"Home|Anonymous|GasTech\", \n                                 Location)),\n                 aes(x = hour,\n                     y = Location,\n                     fill = stat(x)\n                     )) +\n                 geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3,\n                                              rel_min_height = 0.001) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:24) +\n  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"ABC\", \n                       option = \"A\") +\n  theme_ridges(font_size = 7, \n               grid = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(title = \"Uncovering Location Type Beyond Ambiguous Location Names Using GPS Data\",\n       subtitle = \"High Noon GPS Activity Continue To Suggest Abila Zacharo and Hippokampos As Food Outlets\")\n\nQ5.2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Selected Coffee Chain Activity Still Occur Only At Selected Hours Within The GPS Data\nGPS data shows restricted activity coffee chain activity to just two hours within the day.

This differs from a lack of credit card activity during the same period. Looking at the GPS data, these movements revolved around homes and Kronos Capital. Both these locations are not commercial locations, and thus no credit card transaction is to be expected anyways.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nQ5.2.4_weekday &lt;- data.frame(\"weekday\" = unique(cc[c('weekday')])) %&gt;%\n  slice(rep(1:n(), \n            each = 5))\nQ5.2.4_period &lt;- data.frame(\"period\" = unique(cc[c('period')]))\nQ5.2.4_period$period &lt;- factor(Q5.2.4_period$period,\n                                levels = c(\"Morning 6am to 11.59am\",\n                                           \"Afternoon 12noon to 5.59pm\",\n                                           \"Evening 6pm to 8.59pm\",\n                                           \"Late Evening 9pm to 11.59pm\",\n                                           \"Late Night 12mn to 5.59am\"))\nQ5.2.4_period &lt;- as.data.frame(lapply(Q5.2.4_period,\n                                      rep,\n                                      7))\nQ5.2.4_combined &lt;- cbind(Q5.2.4_weekday,\n                         Q5.2.4_period)\n\nrm(Q5.2.4_weekday,\n   Q5.2.4_period) # Remove unused earlier dataset\n\nQ5.2.4_gps &lt;- gps_name %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekday,\n           period) %&gt;%\n  tally() %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nQ5.2.4_combined &lt;- Q5.2.4_combined %&gt;%\n  left_join(Q5.2.4_gps, \n            by = c(\"weekday\" = \"weekday\",\n                   \"period\" = \"period\"))\nQ5.2.4_combined$id &lt;- seq(1, \n                          nrow(Q5.2.4_combined))\nQ5.2.4_combined[36:63,] &lt;- NA\nQ5.2.4_combined[36,4] &lt;- 5.1\nQ5.2.4_combined[37,4] &lt;- 5.2\nQ5.2.4_combined[38,4] &lt;- 5.3\nQ5.2.4_combined[39,4] &lt;- 5.4\nQ5.2.4_combined[40,4] &lt;- 10.1\nQ5.2.4_combined[41,4] &lt;- 10.2\nQ5.2.4_combined[42,4] &lt;- 10.3\nQ5.2.4_combined[43,4] &lt;- 10.4\nQ5.2.4_combined[44,4] &lt;- 15.1\nQ5.2.4_combined[45,4] &lt;- 15.2\nQ5.2.4_combined[46,4] &lt;- 15.3\nQ5.2.4_combined[47,4] &lt;- 15.4\nQ5.2.4_combined[48,4] &lt;- 20.1\nQ5.2.4_combined[49,4] &lt;- 20.2\nQ5.2.4_combined[50,4] &lt;- 20.3\nQ5.2.4_combined[51,4] &lt;- 20.4\nQ5.2.4_combined[52,4] &lt;- 25.1\nQ5.2.4_combined[53,4] &lt;- 25.2\nQ5.2.4_combined[54,4] &lt;- 25.3\nQ5.2.4_combined[55,4] &lt;- 25.4\nQ5.2.4_combined[56,4] &lt;- 30.1\nQ5.2.4_combined[57,4] &lt;- 30.2\nQ5.2.4_combined[58,4] &lt;- 30.3\nQ5.2.4_combined[59,4] &lt;- 30.4\nQ5.2.4_combined[60,4] &lt;- 35.1\nQ5.2.4_combined[61,4] &lt;- 35.2\nQ5.2.4_combined[62,4] &lt;- 35.3\nQ5.2.4_combined[63,4] &lt;- 35.4\n\nrm(Q5.2.4_gps) # Remove unused earlier dataset\n\nQ5.2.4_combined &lt;- Q5.2.4_combined %&gt;%\n  arrange(id)\nQ5.2.4_combined$id &lt;- seq(1, \n                          nrow(Q5.2.4_combined))\nQ5.2.4_combined$period &lt;- factor(Q5.2.4_combined$period,\n                                levels = c(\"Morning 6am to 11.59am\",\n                                           \"Afternoon 12noon to 5.59pm\",\n                                           \"Evening 6pm to 8.59pm\",\n                                           \"Late Evening 9pm to 11.59pm\",\n                                           \"Late Night 12mn to 5.59am\"))\n\nQ5.2.4_label &lt;- Q5.2.4_combined\nQ5.2.4_number_of_bar &lt;- nrow(Q5.2.4_label)\nQ5.2.4_angle &lt;- 90 - 360 * (Q5.2.4_label$id - 0.5) / Q5.2.4_number_of_bar\nQ5.2.4_label$hjust &lt;- ifelse(Q5.2.4_angle &lt;

What is your evidence? Where are there uncertainties in your method? Where are there uncertainties in the data? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 500 words.\n\n5.3.1 Combining Both Credit Card and Spots Data Using Fuzzy Join (OSA)\nWe will find matching IDs between the credit card and spots data. Spots data are basically GPS points that have remained stationary for more than 10 mins. The main columns of comparison are the day of month, location and hour, and identical rows are determined as a result. From here, we identify the match, by counting the max number of matching rows between credit card and spots data.\n\nThese matching is on a best match basis, and uncertainties lie in the following areas:\n- Spots data may show a visit to that location, but no purchase may have been made\n- Discrepancy in the credit card data’s date or hour may cause ill-matches\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncc_spots &lt;- cc %&gt;% # Create a new df that shows matches with a max distance difference of 0\n  stringdist_inner_join(spots,\n                        by = c(\"concat_cc_spots\" = \"concat_spots_cc\"),\n                        method = \"osa\",\n                        max_dist = 0,\n                        distance_col = \"distance\")\n\ncc_spots_1 &lt;- cc_spots %&gt;% # Isolate best matching cc and spots with more than 2 counts\n  filter(!is.na(FullName)) %&gt;% # Remove unknown drivers\n  group_by(RoleNName,\n           last4ccnum) %&gt;%\n  count() %&gt;%\n  arrange(RoleNName,\n          -n) %&gt;% # Arrange the highest to lowest count in each group\n  ungroup()\n\ncolnames(cc_spots_1)[colnames(cc_spots_1) == \"n\"] = \"matches\" # Rename last column to matches\n\ncc_summary &lt;- cc %&gt;%\n  group_by(last4ccnum) %&gt;%\n  count() %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\ncc_spots_1 &lt;- cc_spots_1[!duplicated(cc_spots_1$RoleNName),] # Isolating 1 cc to 1 driver\n\nknitr::kable(cc_spots_1, caption = \"Matched Credit Card to ID And Name\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\",\n                full_width = F) # Output matched table\n\n\n\nMatched Credit Card to ID And Name\n\n\nRoleNName\nlast4ccnum\nmatches\n\n\n\n\n1 IT Helpdesk Nils Calixto\n9551\n23\n\n\n10 SVP/CIO Ada Campo-Corrente\n8332\n20\n\n\n11 Hydraulic Technician Axel Calzas\n1321\n21\n\n\n12 Site Control Hideki Cocinaro\n7108\n25\n\n\n13 Site Control Inga Ferro\n7819\n29\n\n\n14 Engineering Group Manager Lidelse Dedos\n1874\n28\n\n\n15 Site Control Loreto Bodrogi\n3853\n28\n\n\n16 Perimeter Control Isia Vann\n7354\n33\n\n\n17 IT Technician Sven Flecha\n7384\n32\n\n\n18 Geologist Birgitta Frente\n9617\n28\n\n\n19 Hydraulic Technician Vira Frente\n6895\n23\n\n\n2 Engineer Lars Azada\n1415\n21\n\n\n20 Building Control Stenig Fusil\n6816\n27\n\n\n21 Perimeter Control Hennie Osvaldo\n9405\n31\n\n\n22 Badging Office Adra Nubarron\n1286\n26\n\n\n23 Badging Office Varja Lagos\n3484\n31\n\n\n24 Perimeter Control Minke Mies\n4434\n28\n\n\n25 Geologist Kanon Herrero\n2142\n29\n\n\n26 Drill Site Manager Marin Onda\n1310\n32\n\n\n27 Drill Technician Kare Orilla\n3492\n25\n\n\n29 Facilities Group Manager Bertrand Ovan\n3547\n20\n\n\n3 Engineer Felix Balas\n9635\n19\n\n\n30 Security Group Manager Felix Resumir\n6901\n31\n\n\n31 President/CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr.\n5010\n5\n\n\n32 SVP/COO Orhan Strum\n8156\n22\n\n\n33 Drill Technician Brand Tempestad\n9683\n24\n\n\n34 Perimeter Control Edvard Vann\n4795\n25\n\n\n35 Environmental Safety Advisor Willem Vasco-Pais\n2463\n20\n\n\n4 SVP/CFO Ingrid Barranco\n7688\n22\n\n\n5 IT Technician Isak Baza\n6899\n19\n\n\n6 IT Group Manager Linnea Bergen\n7253\n27\n\n\n7 Drill Technician Elsa Orilla\n2540\n19\n\n\n8 IT Technician Lucas Alcazar\n7889\n27\n\n\n9 Drill Technician Gustav Cazar\n1877\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing On To Part 2"

Alberto Cairo succinctly sums up the actual intent of the graphic: “what is it that you want people to see”. He went to explain that one should begin not by designing the graphic first but rather, begin by “writing a very long narrative that you want to tell”.\n\nAn attempt on the narrative for the above visualization is as follows:\n\n“The import and export fluctuations within each of its top six trading countries differ greatly between 2019 to 2020, as well as against other top trading countries.”\n\nTo further illuminate the narrative, we propose the following questions that the visualization aims to answer:\n• What are the import and export levels in each of the top six trading countries?\n• How do these import and export levels fluctuate over time?\n• Within the top six countries, who has the highest and lowest import and export levels respectively?\n• (Additional) Do these fluctuations coincide with any event?"

The ideal quadrant to be in is Quadrant I, where it is both clear and beautiful.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Data Visualization Matrix: Clarity vs Aesthetics\n\n\nFrom a definition perspective, aesthetics refers to how pleasing the visualization is to the reader’s eye, while clarity refers to how clear and concise the story or the message behind the visualization is conveyed to the reader."

    "text": "4. Critique of Visualisation\nA critique of the above visualisation will be based on the earlier two criterions.\n\n4.1. Clarity:\nInconsistent vertical scale values intra and inter-countries\nThe vertical scales for both the primary and secondary axis denoting the export and import levels are inconsistent with one another for all six countries. For instance in Hong Kong, the export levels are denoted in millions, whereas the import levels are denoted in hundred thousands.\n\nUnmatched vertical scale values intra and inter-countries\nEven when the scales are denoted in millions, as shown in Japan, the export and import levels don’t match up with each other. In the same Japan instance, export seems to have a higher scale level than its import.\n\nInconsistent horizontal time scale values intra and inter-countries\nThe horizontal time scale values are inconsistent for Japan, as compared to the rest of the countries. Japan’s horizontal time scale only showcases the months of 2020, whereas the other five countries showcases the months of both 2019 and 2020.\n\nUnclear order of top six countries\nThere is no clear explanation on how the countries are arranged, and whether its order or arrangement takes into account the level of merchandise trade with Singapore. Can it be considered that HK is a more significant contributor of merchandise trade to Singapore, than US, solely based on its position within the visualisation?\n\n\n\n\n4.2. Aesthetics:\nLegend shows two colour schemes, but visualisation has three\nThe legend clearly asssigns two distinct colours to export and import respectively, but the graph showcases a third colour. This third colour is a result of the overlapping area between both the export and import portions. Having a third undefined colour forces the reader to decipher for him/herself on what it actually means.\n\nRepeating scale names\nThe vertical scales of Export and Import, as well the horizontal scales of ‘Month of Period’ is repeated six times throughout the whole visualisation.\n\nDiffering width\nExcluding Japan which has only a 2020 time period, the rest of the countries with a 2019-2020 time period have differing graph widths. Hong Kong has a narrower graph width than Malaysia, which is located just below it.\n\nLegend takes up too much valuable real estate\nSince the legend position is situated on the top right corner of the visualisation, the space below it on the right side of the visualisation is very much wasted. Relocating this legend either above or below, could have made the visualisation wider."

    "text": "5. Alternative Design\n\n5.1. Suggested Improvements\nThe use of an area chart in the original visualisation is ideal, given the fluctuations between the export and import levels across the time period. As such, the following suggestions are mere tweaks to the original visualisation:\n• Consistent and matching vertical and horizontal scales\n• Countries ordered in terms of overall merchandise trade\n• Keep to two colour schemes\n• Reduce repeated scale names\n• Consistent chart widths\n• Reposition or replace legend\n• Presence of a header/sub-header indicating the storyline of the visualisation (with leading commentaries on visualisation itself)\n\n\n5.2. Finding Inspiration\nReusing the same area charts, we now scour everywhere for great inspiration!\n\nTaking a leaf from history, the visualisation on Commercial and Political Atlas by William Playfair intuitively showcases the difference in levels within the area chart. The use of different colour schemes allow the reader to understand which areas have higher amounts than another. Though it only uses one area chart, it helps that this inspired visualisation is also based on exports and imports, similar to this makeover!\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Historical Visualisation on Export and Import Levels Between England and Two Other Countries (Denmark and Norway)\n\n\n\n\n5.3. Sketch\nThe following sketch strives to find common ground between the original visualisation and its critiques, as well as the historical inspiration above."

Singapore’s exports to HK far outstrip HK’s imports into Singapore, with Mar-2020 recording the widest 2 year gap.\n\nThe converse is true for Taiwan. Taiwan’s imports to Singapore consistently outstrip Singapore’s exports to Taiwan, with Oct-2020 recording the widest 2 year gap.\n\nFor the United States, import levels were consistently higher prior to Apr-2020. From this point onwards, export to the United States became consistently higher.\n\nSimilarly for Malaysia, from Dec-2021 onwards, import consistently outgrew export. Prior to this, export and import levels greatly overlapped each other.\n\nThough at different levels, both the export and import levels within Mainland China and Japan fluctuate consistently."
