While it’s easy to merge gps and car data using its unique ID, there are no unique fields tying the cc and loyalty data together. Thus, merging both cc and loyalty data together would require some form of fuzzy joining logic. Separately, to add to the complexity, we would need to identify the various locations within the gps data, using both the cc and mc2 map.\nWith these dataset in mind, the following considerations would need to be addressed:\n\n2.1 Fuzzy Matching\nThere are a few ways to employ fuzzy matching in our dataset. One is to use the native adist function within R, but its processing time leaves much to be desired. The other is to use packages specifically designed for fuzzy matching. One such package that is built for speed in matching similar phrases is stringdist. It uses openMP for parallel computing to speed up its matching of unequal content. The only downside (though it’s hardly a downside) is that it requires the columns of comparison to be housed in the same dataframe. Fuzzyjoin, built on top of stringdist, allows comparison of columns housed in different dataset, and its output include a merging of both datasets.\nUnfortunately, deciding on the fuzzy logic package is the easy part. The harder part is to decide on the appropriate fuzzy join logic. Here’s a list of distance metrics currently supported by stringdist:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nosa\nOptimal string aligment, (restricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance)\n\n\nlv\nLevenshtein distance (as in R’s native adist).\n\n\ndl\nFull Damerau-Levenshtein distance.\n\n\nhamming\nHamming distance (a and b must have same nr of characters).\n\n\nlcs\nLongest common substring distance\n\n\nqgram\nq-gram distance\n\n\ncosine\ncosine distance between q-gram profiles\n\n\njaccard\nJaccard distance between q-gram profiles\n\n\njw\nJaro, or Jaro-Winkler distance\n\n\n\nOut of the above methods, osa, lv and dl seems most apt, since we’re dealing with phrases with differing lengths and are more concerned with slight edits, realignment, addition and subtraction of letters within these phrases. We’ll rely on the osa method since it’s a balance between finding the right edits and speed.\n\n\n2.2 Map Visualisations of GPS Data\nWhile it makes sense to convert our GPS points into spatial lines, using the furnished map pic as a basemap is less than ideal. As shown below, it’s unclear whether the GPS path coincides with the location icons shown on the map. These icons are far too large, and does not reflect whether these GPS points either stopped at or merely drove past these points. At the same time, the GPS path seem to run on a road network, that is not reflected within the furnished map pic."
